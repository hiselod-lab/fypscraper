If yes, why?\nYes, the verification of identity of customers using NADRA Verisys shall continue to be\npermissible in cases where verification cannot be done through biometric due to genuine\nreasons or technical issues.\n8)\nWhat are the genuine reasons or technical issues referred in FAQ No. 7) above?\nFollowing scenarios may be considered: provided MFB is satisfied and proper reason/ proof\nis recorded/ retained by the MFB;\na) NADRA system/data/connectivity or technical issue beyond a reasonable time\nb) NADRA does not have biometric records of prospective customers.\nc) Customers whose eligible identity documents are other than biometrically verifiable\ndocuments, e.g. Passport, Alien Registration Card, etc."

In this regard, biometric verification should be done once the issue\nis resolved, subject to reasonable time limit to be defined by institutions in their internal\npolicies.\n10)\nCan biometric verification be conducted offsite or only in MFB premises?\nIt is discretion of the MFB to use mobile devices for verification of customers outside the\nMFB premises while following regulatory requirements. However, no exemption may be\npresumed from any of the requirements laid down under relevant law, AML/CFT\nRegulations/ guidelines and it should be ensured that accounts will ultimately be opened in\nMFB branches and initial/ subsequent deposits will only be received in MFB branches.\n11)\nCan certain low risk accounts be exempted from the requirement of biometric\nverification?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n12)\nIs biometric verification exempted under bulk account opening propositions e.g. payroll\naccounts, etc.?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n13)\nWhat minimum information should be sufficient in biometric verification?\nThe verification using biometric, at the minimum, should have particulars of prospective\ncustomers verified by MFBs through NADRA Verisys. This should include (i) individual’s\nname; (ii) father’s name; (iii) date of birth; (iv) mother’s maiden name or individual’s place\nof birth; (v) identity card number; (vi) identity card expiry date; (vii) permanent & current\naddress; and (viii) photograph.\n14)\nIs any activity permitted in MFB account prior to biometric verification of customer?\nIn terms of Regulation M 1 Customer Due Diligence (Para 6), it is permitted to accept initial\ndeposit at the time of submission of necessary documents by their prospective customers,\nprior to verification, and provisionally open accounts subject to certain controls. However,\nthere should be no transaction activity in the account except initial deposit prior to\ncompletion of verification of identity of the customer.\n15)\nIs there any specification of biometric device to be used for biometric verification of\ncustomers?\nNo, the selection or specification of biometric device is decided by MFBs in consultation\nwith NADRA as per their system functionality."

In this regard, biometric verification should be done once the issue\nis resolved, subject to reasonable time limit to be defined by institutions in their internal\npolicies.\n10)\nCan biometric verification be conducted offsite or only in MFB premises?\nIt is discretion of the MFB to use mobile devices for verification of customers outside the\nMFB premises while following regulatory requirements. However, no exemption may be\npresumed from any of the requirements laid down under relevant law, AML/CFT\nRegulations/ guidelines and it should be ensured that accounts will ultimately be opened in\nMFB branches and initial/ subsequent deposits will only be received in MFB branches.\n11)\nCan certain low risk accounts be exempted from the requirement of biometric\nverification?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n12)\nIs biometric verification exempted under bulk account opening propositions e.g. payroll\naccounts, etc.?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n13)\nWhat minimum information should be sufficient in biometric verification?\nThe verification using biometric, at the minimum, should have particulars of prospective\ncustomers verified by MFBs through NADRA Verisys. This should include (i) individual’s\nname; (ii) father’s name; (iii) date of birth; (iv) mother’s maiden name or individual’s place\nof birth; (v) identity card number; (vi) identity card expiry date; (vii) permanent & current\naddress; and (viii) photograph.\n14)\nIs any activity permitted in MFB account prior to biometric verification of customer?\nIn terms of Regulation M 1 Customer Due Diligence (Para 6), it is permitted to accept initial\ndeposit at the time of submission of necessary documents by their prospective customers,\nprior to verification, and provisionally open accounts subject to certain controls. However,\nthere should be no transaction activity in the account except initial deposit prior to\ncompletion of verification of identity of the customer.\n15)\nIs there any specification of biometric device to be used for biometric verification of\ncustomers?\nNo, the selection or specification of biometric device is decided by MFBs in consultation\nwith NADRA as per their system functionality."

This shall include but not be limited to verification of antecedents and screening procedures\nto verify that person being inducted/hired has a clean history.

In this regard, biometric verification should be done once the issue\nis resolved, subject to reasonable time limit to be defined by institutions in their internal\npolicies.\n10)\nCan biometric verification be conducted offsite or only in MFB premises?\nIt is discretion of the MFB to use mobile devices for verification of customers outside the\nMFB premises while following regulatory requirements. However, no exemption may be\npresumed from any of the requirements laid down under relevant law, AML/CFT\nRegulations/ guidelines and it should be ensured that accounts will ultimately be opened in\nMFB branches and initial/ subsequent deposits will only be received in MFB branches.\n11)\nCan certain low risk accounts be exempted from the requirement of biometric\nverification?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n12)\nIs biometric verification exempted under bulk account opening propositions e.g. payroll\naccounts, etc.?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n13)\nWhat minimum information should be sufficient in biometric verification?\nThe verification using biometric, at the minimum, should have particulars of prospective\ncustomers verified by MFBs through NADRA Verisys. This should include (i) individual’s\nname; (ii) father’s name; (iii) date of birth; (iv) mother’s maiden name or individual’s place\nof birth; (v) identity card number; (vi) identity card expiry date; (vii) permanent & current\naddress; and (viii) photograph.\n14)\nIs any activity permitted in MFB account prior to biometric verification of customer?\nIn terms of Regulation M 1 Customer Due Diligence (Para 6), it is permitted to accept initial\ndeposit at the time of submission of necessary documents by their prospective customers,\nprior to verification, and provisionally open accounts subject to certain controls. However,\nthere should be no transaction activity in the account except initial deposit prior to\ncompletion of verification of identity of the customer.\n15)\nIs there any specification of biometric device to be used for biometric verification of\ncustomers?\nNo, the selection or specification of biometric device is decided by MFBs in consultation\nwith NADRA as per their system functionality."

If yes, why?\nYes, the verification of identity of customers using NADRA Verisys shall continue to be\npermissible in cases where verification cannot be done through biometric due to genuine\nreasons or technical issues.\n8)\nWhat are the genuine reasons or technical issues referred in FAQ No. 7) above?\nFollowing scenarios may be considered: provided MFB is satisfied and proper reason/ proof\nis recorded/ retained by the MFB;\na) NADRA system/data/connectivity or technical issue beyond a reasonable time\nb) NADRA does not have biometric records of prospective customers.\nc) Customers whose eligible identity documents are other than biometrically verifiable\ndocuments, e.g. Passport, Alien Registration Card, etc."

In this regard, biometric verification should be done once the issue\nis resolved, subject to reasonable time limit to be defined by institutions in their internal\npolicies.\n10)\nCan biometric verification be conducted offsite or only in MFB premises?\nIt is discretion of the MFB to use mobile devices for verification of customers outside the\nMFB premises while following regulatory requirements. However, no exemption may be\npresumed from any of the requirements laid down under relevant law, AML/CFT\nRegulations/ guidelines and it should be ensured that accounts will ultimately be opened in\nMFB branches and initial/ subsequent deposits will only be received in MFB branches.\n11)\nCan certain low risk accounts be exempted from the requirement of biometric\nverification?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n12)\nIs biometric verification exempted under bulk account opening propositions e.g. payroll\naccounts, etc.?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n13)\nWhat minimum information should be sufficient in biometric verification?\nThe verification using biometric, at the minimum, should have particulars of prospective\ncustomers verified by MFBs through NADRA Verisys. This should include (i) individual’s\nname; (ii) father’s name; (iii) date of birth; (iv) mother’s maiden name or individual’s place\nof birth; (v) identity card number; (vi) identity card expiry date; (vii) permanent & current\naddress; and (viii) photograph.\n14)\nIs any activity permitted in MFB account prior to biometric verification of customer?\nIn terms of Regulation M 1 Customer Due Diligence (Para 6), it is permitted to accept initial\ndeposit at the time of submission of necessary documents by their prospective customers,\nprior to verification, and provisionally open accounts subject to certain controls. However,\nthere should be no transaction activity in the account except initial deposit prior to\ncompletion of verification of identity of the customer.\n15)\nIs there any specification of biometric device to be used for biometric verification of\ncustomers?\nNo, the selection or specification of biometric device is decided by MFBs in consultation\nwith NADRA as per their system functionality."

In this regard, biometric verification should be done once the issue\nis resolved, subject to reasonable time limit to be defined by institutions in their internal\npolicies.\n10)\nCan biometric verification be conducted offsite or only in MFB premises?\nIt is discretion of the MFB to use mobile devices for verification of customers outside the\nMFB premises while following regulatory requirements. However, no exemption may be\npresumed from any of the requirements laid down under relevant law, AML/CFT\nRegulations/ guidelines and it should be ensured that accounts will ultimately be opened in\nMFB branches and initial/ subsequent deposits will only be received in MFB branches.\n11)\nCan certain low risk accounts be exempted from the requirement of biometric\nverification?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n12)\nIs biometric verification exempted under bulk account opening propositions e.g. payroll\naccounts, etc.?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n13)\nWhat minimum information should be sufficient in biometric verification?\nThe verification using biometric, at the minimum, should have particulars of prospective\ncustomers verified by MFBs through NADRA Verisys. This should include (i) individual’s\nname; (ii) father’s name; (iii) date of birth; (iv) mother’s maiden name or individual’s place\nof birth; (v) identity card number; (vi) identity card expiry date; (vii) permanent & current\naddress; and (viii) photograph.\n14)\nIs any activity permitted in MFB account prior to biometric verification of customer?\nIn terms of Regulation M 1 Customer Due Diligence (Para 6), it is permitted to accept initial\ndeposit at the time of submission of necessary documents by their prospective customers,\nprior to verification, and provisionally open accounts subject to certain controls. However,\nthere should be no transaction activity in the account except initial deposit prior to\ncompletion of verification of identity of the customer.\n15)\nIs there any specification of biometric device to be used for biometric verification of\ncustomers?\nNo, the selection or specification of biometric device is decided by MFBs in consultation\nwith NADRA as per their system functionality."

In this regard, biometric verification should be done once the issue\nis resolved, subject to reasonable time limit to be defined by institutions in their internal\npolicies.\n10)\nCan biometric verification be conducted offsite or only in MFB premises?\nIt is discretion of the MFB to use mobile devices for verification of customers outside the\nMFB premises while following regulatory requirements. However, no exemption may be\npresumed from any of the requirements laid down under relevant law, AML/CFT\nRegulations/ guidelines and it should be ensured that accounts will ultimately be opened in\nMFB branches and initial/ subsequent deposits will only be received in MFB branches.\n11)\nCan certain low risk accounts be exempted from the requirement of biometric\nverification?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n12)\nIs biometric verification exempted under bulk account opening propositions e.g. payroll\naccounts, etc.?\nNo, unless explicitly allowed in special circumstances by SBP.\n13)\nWhat minimum information should be sufficient in biometric verification?\nThe verification using biometric, at the minimum, should have particulars of prospective\ncustomers verified by MFBs through NADRA Verisys. This should include (i) individual’s\nname; (ii) father’s name; (iii) date of birth; (iv) mother’s maiden name or individual’s place\nof birth; (v) identity card number; (vi) identity card expiry date; (vii) permanent & current\naddress; and (viii) photograph.\n14)\nIs any activity permitted in MFB account prior to biometric verification of customer?\nIn terms of Regulation M 1 Customer Due Diligence (Para 6), it is permitted to accept initial\ndeposit at the time of submission of necessary documents by their prospective customers,\nprior to verification, and provisionally open accounts subject to certain controls. However,\nthere should be no transaction activity in the account except initial deposit prior to\ncompletion of verification of identity of the customer."
